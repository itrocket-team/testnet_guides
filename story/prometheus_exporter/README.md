# Prometheus Exporter

This custom Prometheus exporter allows you to extract comprehensive blockchain data, including total supply metrics and detailed validator information. The exporter provides a set of metrics that offer insights into various attributes of validators, such as:

- Validator Addresses (hex_address, consensus_address, operator_address)
- Bond Status
- Jailed Status
- Unbonding Height
- Unbonding Time
- Delegator Shares
- Total Supply

The exporter is useful for anyone interested in monitoring the state and performance of validators in a blockchain network through Prometheus-compatible monitoring tools.
