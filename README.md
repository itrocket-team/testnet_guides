<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## ðŸš€ About Us

We are team of DevOps engineers from Armenia :armenia:. We are crypto enthusiasts & node operators in various crypto ecosystems. Our goal is to help millions of people effectively manage their crypto assets!

We think you may like our services because:
* We have low commission.
* We use ssh keys to login in our servers and disable password login and configure a firewall with a limited connection. All our keys are stored in a safe place and we are using a hardware key where it is possible. Our priority is security and reliability of your funds.
* We run nodes on dedicated servers in Europe, USA and Canada. We use monitoring tools 24/7 with Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboard and telegram bots alerting system.
